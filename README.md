As the owner of a bot with a command that takes screenshots of websites, you may be wondering why I can only make this command available in NSFW channels on Discord. This restriction is in place to ensure that the bot does not inadvertently expose users to illegal or explicit content.

There are numerous websites on the internet that contain content that is not suitable for all audiences. Some of these websites contain pornography, while others promote hate speech or illegal activities. As the owner of a bot that takes screenshots of websites, I need to be aware of the potential risks associated with exposing users to this content.

Discord has a responsibility to ensure that its platform is safe for all users, which is why the platform has a zero-tolerance policy when it comes to illegal or explicit content. By limiting the availability of my bot's /preview command to NSFW channels, I can help ensure that my bot is not inadvertently exposing users to content that violates Discord's policies.

It's important to note that this restriction is not meant to limit the functionality of my bot. You can still execute the /preview command in NSFW channels. However, I should be mindful of the potential risks associated with exposing users to illegal or explicit content and take steps to ensure that my bot is not contributing to this problem.

In conclusion, the restriction on my bot's /preview command is in place to ensure that my bot is not inadvertently exposing users to illegal or explicit content. By limiting the availability of this command to NSFW channels, I can help ensure that your bot is not contributing to this problem and that Discord remains a safe and welcoming platform for all users.
